=== Creditworthiness Assessment ===

1. DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) = Net Operating Income / Debt Repayments
   - DSCR > 1.25 is considered healthy

2. Credit Limit Guidelines:
   - 25%–40% of Net Working Capital (NWC)
   - OR 3x–5x annual Net Profit, depending on debt

3. Negative cash flows reduce repayment capacity.

4. Consistent profits, positive OCF, and low debt = high creditworthiness.

5. High leverage (debt/equity > 2) or losses = lower creditworthiness.

6. Free cash flow must be sufficient to cover debt repayments.

Banks use a mix of historical data and projections to decide permissible loan limits.
