=== Income Statement Metrics ===
- Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
- Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
- Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
- Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense

=== Balance Sheet Metrics ===
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Shareholder Equity
- Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Equity

=== Cash Flow Metrics ===
- Operating Cash Flow (OCF): should be positive
- Free Cash Flow = OCF - Capital Expenditures
- Negative OCF for multiple years is risky

Financial performance is assessed by combining trends from all three statements.
