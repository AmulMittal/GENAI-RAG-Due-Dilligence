      "1. Liquidity:\n",
      "- The Cash Flow Statement mentions cash and cash equivalents consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits with banks, indicating the company's liquidity position.\n",
      "- The company's ability to pay its current obligations can be assessed by analyzing the Current Ratio and Quick Ratio from the Balance Sheet metrics. A Current Ratio below 1 would indicate liquidity risk, while a Quick Ratio above 1 would suggest better short-term liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Solvency:\n",
      "- The Debt-to-Equity ratio is a key indicator of solvency. A Debt-to-Equity ratio above 2.0 is considered a red flag for solvency, indicating high leverage and potential financial risk.\n",
      "- The company's ability to cover interest expenses relative to its operating profit is crucial for solvency. High interest expenses compared to operating profit could be a solvency concern.\n",
      "- The company's ability to generate positive and growing operating cash flow is a positive indicator of solvency. Negative operating cash flow over multiple years is a red flag for solvency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the liquidity and solvency of the company can be further evaluated by analyzing its cash flow position, debt levels, interest coverage, and operating cash flow trends in conjunction with the financial flags provided.\n"
